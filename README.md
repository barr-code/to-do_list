##To-Do List
Using [Meteor's tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/try), I built this to-do list.

### Languages and Tools
```
	- Meteor
	- JavaScript
	- MongoDB
```

### To Use
Install Meteor.
```
	$ curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```
Clone this repository.
```
	$ git clone https://github.com/barr-code/to-do_list.git
```
Change into the directory.
```

```
Fire up the server.
```
	$ meteor
```
Visit localhost:3000 and add some tasks to your to-do list!
